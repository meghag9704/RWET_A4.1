My brain won’t accept it but things have changed. 
You have changed and my brain won’t accept it.
I have changed and my brain won’t accept it. 
I look out into the mirror and see the same brown eyes 
But they are a little bit darker
A little bit shrouded
With a fire resembling fear 
And the thirst quenched with answers
